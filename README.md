# FrontendAssignment

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.8.

## Assumptions

-I have assumed that the data should be filtered for a period of only one week. The default value for the End Date range has been set to the current date, while the Start Date range is set as 7 days ago.

- Furthermore, I assume that following the data filtration based on date and time, the 'data_value' should be presented within the table row in accordance with the corresponding time slot format, such as "12:00 am - 01:00 pm," and the respective day, such as "Monday."

- I have also written testcases for the table.component.ts and date-range-picker.component.ts

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
